# RSA-PSO: Hybrid Reptile Search Algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository presents a modified version of the **Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA)**, enhanced with **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** elements to improve convergence speed, exploitation capabilities, and overall optimization performance.

## ðŸ§  About the Hybrid Algorithm

Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) is a bio-inspired optimization technique based on the hunting behavior of crocodiles. Although RSA shows promising results, it can suffer from premature convergence and local optima entrapment. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid algorithm, **RSA-PSO**, which incorporates the velocity and position update mechanism of **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** into the RSA framework. This hybridization enhances both the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the original algorithm.
